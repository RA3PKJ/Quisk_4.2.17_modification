# Quisk modification

Quisk modification for Windows and Linux.

Now the source code of Quisk 4.2.18 (by Jim N2ADR) is used for modification.  
I am creating a 32-bit Quisk for Windows 32/64.

For Windows 32/64 please use 32-bit versions of the:
- python-3.9.5.exe
- wxPython-4.1.1-cp39-cp39-win32.whl

Releases for Windows - http://ra3pkj.ru/page34.shtml

For linux, first install the original version of Quisk according to the instructions from http://james.ahlstrom.name/quisk/docs.html, and then replace quisk folder by taking from this repository. Run the command - make quisk3.
